        Hello Friends; This site was borne of a desire to escape the overwhelmingly negative discourse surrounding one of my favorite games.
        It began at the top of Season of the Witch as a spreadsheet to sort and organize every shader and maybe identify unique things about them. 
        Just because our guardians have slayed alien gods doesn't mean we can't all look good doing it.
