				Hello Friends; This site was borne of a desire to focus on some of the
				things I love about one of my favorite games. It began as a spreadsheet
				to sort and organize every shader and maybe identify unique things about
				them. I realized the functionality of sorting through the shaders and
				maybe even having them applied or saved in-game while I'm browsing would
				be a neat feature.
			</p>
			<p class="p-4">
				Leave a comment on the Contact page or reach out to one of the
				associated social pages and let me know what you think! I am constantly
				trying to learn more about this process to add better functionality so
				you can spend less time searching for your unique look and more time
				showing it off to your fireteam and enemies.
